        for the purpose of business communications.

        <span>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can visit our website without telling us who you are or revealing

        such as working to continually upgrade our website.
      </p>

        <span>How Do We Use Cookies?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        When you visit the website, we may place a “cookie” on the hard drive of
        your computer to track your visit. A cookie is a small data file that is
        transferred to your hard drive through your web browser that can only be
        read by the website that placed the cookie on your hard drive. The
        cookie acts as an identification card and allows our website to identify
        you and to record your passwords and preferences. The cookie allows us
        to track your visit to the website so that we can better understand your
        use of our website so that we can customize and tailor the website to
        better meet your needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, on most web
        browsers you may change this setting to have your web browser either:
        (1) notify you prior to a website placing a cookie on your hard drive so
        that you can decide whether or not to accept the cookie; or (2)
        automatically prevent the placing of a cookie on your hard drive. It
        should be noted that if cookies are not accepted, you will not be able
        to access a number of web pages found on the website.

        Our website may contain links to other websites that may be subject to
        less stringent privacy standards. We cannot assume any responsibility
        for the privacy practices, policies or actions of the third parties that
        operate these websites. Dwella is not responsible for how such third
        parties collect, use or disclose your personal information. You should

      <p>
        <span>Why Do We Collect, Use and Disclose Personal Information?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The personal information collected is used and disclosed for our
        business purposes, including for those purposes explained in this
        policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your personal information may be shared with our employees, contractors,
        consultants, affiliates and other parties who require such information
        to assist us with establishing, maintaining and managing our
        relationship with you. In addition, personal information may be
        disclosed or transferred to another party in the event of a change in
        ownership of, or a grant of a security interest in, all or a part of
        Dwella.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your

        <span>Your Consent Is Important to Us</span>
      </p>
      <p>

        products or services from, you. All communications with respect to such
        withdrawal or variation of consent should be in writing and addressed to
        our Privacy Officer.

      <p>
        <span>How Is Your Personal Information Protected?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dwella endeavours to maintain physical, technical and procedural
        safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal
        information in question. These safeguards are designed to prevent your
        personal information from loss and unauthorized access, copying, use,
        modification or disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed
        to be 100% secure. As a result, while this website strives to protect
        your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any
        information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once
        this website receives your transmission, we make commercially reasonable
        efforts to ensure its security on our systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Updating Your Personal Information</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important that the information contained in our records is both
        accurate and current. If your personal information happens to change
        during the course of our relationship, please keep us informed of such
        changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some circumstances we may not agree with your request to change your
        personal information and will instead append an alternative text to the
        record in question.

        Dwella from time to time, may make changes to this Privacy Policy to

      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy includes examples but is not intended to be
        restricted in its application to such examples; therefore where the word
        “including” is used, it shall mean “including without limitation”.

        to, any rights or obligations imposed by Canada’s federal and provincial
        privacy laws, as applicable. Should there be, in a specific case, any
        inconsistency between this Privacy Policy and Canada’s federal and
        provincial privacy laws, as applicable, this Privacy Policy shall be
        interpreted, in respect of that case, to give effect to, and comply
        with, such privacy laws.

      <p>12. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</p>
      <p>
        In no event will the Company parties be liable to you for any direct,
        indirect, consequential, incidental, special, compensatory or punitive
        damages or losses or damages for loss of income, loss of business
        profits, business interruption, loss of data or business information,
        loss of or damage to property and claims of third parties or other
        pecuniary loss, arising out of or related to these terms, the use of
        this website or the services. Company Parties will not be liable for any
        actual or alleged infringement by any third party materials available
        through the services. In no event will the cumulative liability of
        Company Parties arising out of or related to these terms exceed the
        amount paid by you in the one month immediately prior to any claim. To
        the extent that some jurisdictions do not allow exclusions or
        limitations on some categories of damages, these exclusions or
        limitations may not apply to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foregoing disclaimers and limitations of liability apply regardless
        of the causes, circumstances or form of action giving rise to the loss,
        damage, claim or liability, even if such loss, damage, claim or
        liability is based upon breach of contract (including, without
        limitation, a claim of fundamental breach or breach of a fundamental
        term), tort (including, without limitation, negligence), strict
        liability or any other legal or equitable theory, and even if advised of
        the possibility of the loss, damage, delay, claim or liability.
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that these Terms present a fair allocation of
        risk and liability, and that this Section 12 is an essential part of the
        bargain between the Parties, a controlling factor in setting any fees or
        other charges, and an inducement to the Parties to enter into these
        Terms.
      </p>
      <p>13. GENERAL</p>
      <p>
        These Terms, the Privacy Policy and all other notices, policies and
        statements contained on this Website (all as may be amended by the
        Company from time to time without prior notice) constitute the entire
        agreement between the Company and you. These Terms cannot be modified
        except as described herein. Anything in this Website inconsistent with
        these Terms is superseded by these Terms. No waiver of any of these
        Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such Term or any
        other Term. If in any jurisdiction, any of these Terms are held to be
        unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such Terms will be
        restricted or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and the
        remaining Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect. The
        headings used in these Terms are included for convenience only and will
        not limit or otherwise affect these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The relationship between the Company and you will be that of independent
        contractors or consumers, and neither of us nor any of our respective
        officers, agents or employees will be held or construed to be partners,
        joint ventures, fiduciaries, employees or agents of the other as a
        result of these Terms or this Website
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms and the subject matter of these Terms and all related
        matters will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws
        of the Province of Ontario, Canada and the laws of Canada applicable in
        Ontario, excluding any laws that implement the United Nations Convention
        on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or the United States
        Uniform Commercial Code, and excluding any rules of private
        international law or the conflict of laws that would lead to the
        application of any other laws. Subject to the following paragraph, you
        submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of
        Ontario.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the extent permitted by applicable law, unless the Company agrees
        otherwise, any claim, dispute or controversy, whether in contract or
        tort, pursuant to statute or regulation, or otherwise, and whether
        pre-existing, present or future, arising out of or relating to the
        Services, this Website, these Terms or the Privacy Policy, will be
        determined by final and binding arbitration to the exclusion of the
        courts. Where applicable, arbitration will be conducted in the province
        of Ontario, on a simplified and expedited basis by one arbitrator
        pursuant to the current laws and rules relating to commercial
        arbitration in the province or jurisdiction in which you reside on the
        date of the notice. The foregoing does not, however, preclude the
        Company from seeking injunctive relief in other jurisdictions when
        necessary to protect its interests. You agree that any dispute
        resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and
        not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason
        a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you waive any
        right to a jury trial.

        These Terms have been drawn up in the English language at the express
        request of the parties. Les présentes modalités ont été rédigées en
        anglais à la demande expresse des parties.
